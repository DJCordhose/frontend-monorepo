__Given the typical technical and structural requirements of a business application what are the recommended technology choices and architectural nuggets?__

## Architecture / Tech

This is my recommended tech stack for a typical enterprise application. Underlying assumptions of most important requirements
- Long service life (often more than 10 years) and thus good maintainability
- Development with several teams and members changing over the years 
- Good structuring possibilities for large and complex applications 
- Fast development speed

## Is architecture just clueless talking and useless Visios? (Well, it can be...)

Architecture is the sum of the important Processes, Structures, Patterns, Architectural Nuggets and Frameworks. Important can mean

* _hard to change, but somewhat risky_, 
* _affecting many teams/people or large parts of the software_, 
* _restricting what can be built reasonably_, 
* _having the potential to make the endeavor fail_.

Idea of Architectural Nuggets taken from: https://pkruchten.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/kruchten-2020-northrop-award.pdf

Also from Kruchten: _The life of a software architect is a long and sometimes
painful succession of suboptimal decisions taken partly in the dark._

Definition of architecture inspired by: https://martinfowler.com/architecture/

## Most important Architectural decisions

- https://djcordhose.github.io/spa-workshop/2020_arch.html#/state-management
- https://nilshartmann.github.io/react-training/2020_1211_react.html#/t-state
- Redux
  - https://redux.js.org/
  - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/
    - Motivation
      - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
      - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
      - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
    - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript
    - https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure#how-should-i-split-my-logic-between-reducers-and-action-creators-where-should-my-business-logic-go
      - "Find the balance between these two extremes, and you will master Redux."
    - Effects ngrx-style: https://github.com/davidkpiano/useEffectReducer
- MobX
  - https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html
  - https://michel.codes/blogs/mobx6
  - https://nilshartmann.github.io/react-training/2020_1211_react.html#/t-mobx
- XState
  - https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate
  - https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/tree/master/packages/xstate-react
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/xstate-react-typescript-template-wjdvn?file=/src/index.tsx
- Comparison based on single/multi and direct/indirect: https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1353712136372039682
  - "state management is the wild west and the categories aren't mutually exclusive (and can become each other with abstractions/convention), so it's a rough categorization"
  

### Macro-Structure of modules and dependencies
#### Modular Monolith
- Development in a monorepo
  - https://lerna.js.org/
  - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/
- Code Splitting: 
  - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting
  - https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting
- Make or buy lib
- CSS or Component lib?
  - don't mix well
- Build your own lib
  - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/
  - https://lerna.js.org/
  - https://blog.harveydelaney.com/creating-your-own-react-component-library/
  -  modes of maintenance
    1. corporate: use is mandatory for all, high risk in quality and suitability of lib
    2. agile: use recommended, usage shows quality and suitability of lib
  -  ownership?
  -  What to publish?

#### Micro Frontends
- https://micro-frontends.org/
- https://the-tractor.store/
  - https://github.com/naltatis/micro-frontends-in-action-code
- Server-Side Integration
  - SSI (Server-Side Include): http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.html 
  - Pure Verticals: Separate apps using classic links
- Client-Side Integration
  - iFrame: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe
  - WebComponent: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components
  - AppShell: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell 

### Micro-Structure within a module
- Structure module into features
  - one folder per feature
    - https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/tree/main/packages/counter/src/features
  - do not separate by technicalities
  - single slice file containing all logic
  - https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide#structure-files-as-feature-folders-with-single-file-logic
- Keep tests together with application code
  - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#filename-conventions
- Separate components into smart and dumb
  - indicate type of component by folder or file name
  - if you decide against this sort of category at least are aware of the concept
  - Smart Component 
    - manages state and logic (might delegate to state management lib)
    - orchestrates other components
    - triggers side effects (like loading or saving data)
    - logic makes them domain specific
    - https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/counter/src/features/counter/Counter.tsx
  - Dumb Components
    - layout
    - relaying events to smart components 
    - https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/zeigermann-component-lib/src/AriaButton.tsx
    - probably reusable
    - document properties
  - Reference (German)
    - http://blog.embarc.de/spicker/#9
    - https://djcordhose.github.io/spa-workshop/2020_arch.html#/innere-struktur
- each component should do a minimal task
  - thus be kept at minimal size
  - anything larger than 100 lines might be a smell
- a file can contain more than one component
  - you can have private components only used in the main component
    - will show as a component in tooling
    - can be tested separately
  - a fragment can also be stored in a local variable
    - does not show in tooling and can not be tested in isolation

### Testing

[Dedicated document](./testing.md)


### Styling

* styling is a global concern 
* often underestimated
* a real architectural decision
* don't mix different approaches

#### Options for writing styles
* using globally shared CSS
  * maybe using CSS framework
    * https://tailwindcss.com
      * https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
      * https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production
      * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/counter/tailwind.config.js
    * don't mix with component library
  * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/counter/src/index.tsx#L3
* CSS modules
  * mainstream
  * https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/
  * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/zeigermann-component-lib/src/LoadingIndicator.tsx
* SASS
  * Generally, we recommend that you donâ€™t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a .Button CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own .Button styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but not inherit).
  * can be used for global CSS
  * https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/
  * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/counter/src/common/components/LoadingIndicator.tsx
* Styled Components
  * https://styled-components.com/
  * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/counter/src/features/hello/Hello.tsx  

#### Tooling
* https://postcss.org/
  * checks CSS and adds browser specific prefixes
  * can also bundle, minimize, source maps
* styling with TS
  * generic type declarations needed for CSS: https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/zeigermann-component-lib/src/react-app-env.d.ts#L58
  * specific types can be generated
    * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/zeigermann-component-lib/src/AriaButton.module.css.d.ts
    * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/blob/main/packages/zeigermann-component-lib/rollup.config.js#L10

- Advise
  - Don't overdo it
    - You can go a long way, but you probably shouldn't: https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts
  - Libraries (shared code, also completely internal) can benefit from a lot of typing
  - Application code mainly benefits from typing
    - Often simply making a component TS can bring a huge benefit without adding any type information at all
- Type vs Interface: https://nilshartmann.github.io/typescript-intro/2021_js_ts.html#type-vs-interface

## Less important technical recommendations

### Component Style (classes vs functional components w/ hooks)
* classes and functional components are pretty similar
  * State: re-render
  * Properties
  * Component returns UI
  * Declarative
  * Lifecycle: render and commit phase
  * Classes and functions can be mixed in one app
  * Classes are not deprecated
    * https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#do-i-need-to-rewrite-all-my-class-components
* but  
  * new/future React features may only be available for functions
    * https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#should-i-use-hooks-classes-or-a-mix-of-both 
  * error boundaries only work for classes: https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html
  * life-cycle methods in classes hurt cohesion of code and are error prone
  * useEffect can replace all of them in functional components (but also have a weird api)
  * setState and this-binding of callbacks in classes can be confusing
  * hooks might allow to better extract reusable code (rather than subclassing)
### Data Fetching and Synchronization
- low level
  - just fetch (built-in): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
  - axios (isomporphic): https://axios-http.com/
  - fair comparison of both: https://blog.logrocket.com/axios-or-fetch-api/
- high level
  - for redux toolkit: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview
  - Alternatives: https://react-query.tanstack.com/comparison
- Polling
  - Long Polling
    - make call to server in useEffect
    - once call comes back, do it again
    - can be done in Redux Action Creator
  - Short Polling
    - simple: schedule call to server every x ms using setInterval
    - use lib like:
      - https://react-query.tanstack.com/examples/auto-refetching
      - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/polling
  - Web Sockets
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications

    - Redux Middleware: https://dev.to/aduranil/how-to-use-websockets-with-redux-a-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-understanding-connecting-socket-middleware-to-your-project-km3
  - Server-Sent Events
    - only one direction
    - patterns for receiving like Web Sockets
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events
  - Abstraction over all methods: 
    - https://socket.io/
      - Java Implementation exists, but might be complex: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-java
      - More server side implementations: https://socket.io/docs/v4/#What-Socket-IO-is

## Create React App

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
* https://create-react-app.dev/
* https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app
* Create new projects with CRA
* Leave existing projects as they are and only rethink once you reach a hard boundary
  - also applies to webpack by hand
* Do not create a build from scratch unless you have to
  * you keep spending a lot of time maintaining
  * mostly still is out of data or you make bad choices
  * libs often need different builds and do not work well with CRA
    * rollup might be more desirable here
    * https://github.com/DJCordhose/frontend-monorepo/tree/main/packages/zeigermann-component-lib
  * do it to learn a bit more
    * might want to start with CRA and eject to see what is going on

### Creation
- https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux-typescript
  - yarn create react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
- yarn upgrade typescript --latest

### Tooling and Integration
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/debugging-tests/

### When CRA starts to become limiting

- You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
- Alternatives to CRA: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#more-flexible-toolchains

#### Options
1. eject and ajust config by hand
   - this will feel worse and worse over time
1. build your own react-template or scripts
   - fork the original template in git and adapt it, then you can still eject, but in case of doubt also merge new features
   - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/alternatives-to-ejecting
   - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/
2. https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired
   - a tool that deeply interferes with the internals is problematic
   - not even the authors would use it and since CRA 2 it is hardly maintained
   - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired
   - https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra
4. write a post-install-script for npm that adjusts the webpack config in node_modules/react-scripts
    - this is only a temporary solution, at the same time open issue and hope for fix
